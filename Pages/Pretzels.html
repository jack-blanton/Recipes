<h1>Pretzels</h1>
<i>I hope you know what a pretzel looks like, I love bread with salt.</i>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 1/2 cups (300 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
<li>2 1/4 teaspoons instant dry yeast (one packet)</li>
<li>Scant 1 cup warm water</li>
<li>1/4 cup baking soda</li>
<li>Kosher or coarse sea salt, for sprinkling</li>
<li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructuion</h2>
<ol>
<li>Make the dough: Place the flour, salt, brown sugar, yeast, and warm water in the bowl of a stand mixer with the hook attachment and beat until well combined. Knead the dough, by hand or machine, until it’s smooth and soft, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
<li>Rest the dough: Flour the dough a little, place on a floured surface, and cover. Let rest for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Prep the oven and baking sheets: Preheat the oven to 475°F. Prepare a baking sheet with parchment or nonstick cooking spray.</li>
<li>Divide the dough: Uncover the dough and divide it into eight equal pieces. Let them rest, uncovered, for another 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Twist the pretzels: Using the palms of your hands, roll each piece into a thin rope approximately 25 to 30 inches long. Twist each rope into a pretzel shape by lifting the ends of the rope, crossing them to make a twist, and then folding them back down onto the bottom loop. Gently press the ends so they stay in place.</li>
<li>Make the baking soda bath: Boil 6 to 8 cups water in a large stockpot over high heat and add the baking soda, stirring until it’s dissolved. Reduce to a simmer. Working quickly and carefully, dip each pretzel into the water bath, and simmer for 30 seconds on each side, flipping them with a slotted spoon. They will puff up slightly in the water.</li>
<li>Bake the pretzels: Transfer the pretzels to the prepared baking sheet and sprinkle with coarse sea salt. Bake pretzels until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Brush with butter: Remove from the oven and brush with the melted butter, using up all the butter. These pretzels are best consumed while warm. They can be reheated in the oven, or frozen and defrosted later in a low oven. Top with your favorite mustard, if desired.</li>
